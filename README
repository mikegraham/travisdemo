TravisDemo demonstrates a possible bug in TravisCI.

It's bad practice to name files so generically that they conflict
with standard library filenames such as math.py and email.py.  But
as new files are added to the standard library, advising developers
to avoid name conflicts doesnt scale.  So python 2.5 introduced 
the absolute_import option, which became the default in python 3.
In my `OpenTaxForms <https://github.com/jsaponara/opentaxforms/>`__
project, I had a math.py file until I noticed that it broke my
travis build.  This project exists merely to demonstrate that 
a conflicting python filename breaks the travis build, and perhaps
to prompt some discussion at travis-ci.org about whether this is
a bug.
